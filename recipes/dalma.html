            <strong>Recipe</strong>
            <ol>
                <h4><li>Chop all the vegetables</li></h4>
                To prepare this easy recipe, cut the vegetables in big square size and keep the beans long.

                <h4><li>Cook the moong dal</li></h4>
                For an authentic taste, you can cook in a clay pot else normal kadhai can also be used. First, wash the daal properly then heat your container and add 3 glass of water. Put bay leaves, salt and turmeric powder into it let them boil for a minute or two. Then add the daal and cook well.

                <h4><li>Add all the vegetables in the cooked daal</li></h4>
                After cooking the daal properly, add the vegetables and half cover it. After cooking for a few minutes add crushed ginger and jaggery (as per your taste). After the vegetables get cooked, add grated coconut (keep some for garnishing) and cook for another 5-10 minutes.

                <h4><li>Prepare the tempering</li></h4>
                Heat ghee in a pan and then turn off the flame. Add cumin seeds and asafoetida in the hot ghee, instantly pour it into the dal and cover completely for a minute. This is done, so that the flavour goes inside. Then mix it and garnish with grated coconut and coriander leaves. (Note; This tempering is made without garlic and onion.)

                <h4><li>Tempering with onion and garlic</li></h4>
                Heat some oil in a pan. Add hing and cumin seeds. Then 2-3 whole red chillies and cook till crackling sound. Then, add chopped onions and garlic, cook till golden brown and then add curry leaves. Add some coriander powder, garam masala and Kashmiri red chilli powder for colour (optional). Mix everything and pour the dal into it cook for a minute then garnish with coriander leaves and some grated coconut.Step 1 Chop all the vegetables
